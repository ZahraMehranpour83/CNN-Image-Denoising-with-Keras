CNN Image Denoising with Keras

ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) inspired by U-Net architecture to remove noise from images in the MNIST dataset. The workflow involves adding Gaussian noise to clean images and then training the model to reconstruct the original, noise-free images.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

1. Data Loading â€“ Load MNIST dataset from Keras.


2. Noise Addition â€“ Add Gaussian noise using the add_noise function.


3. Model Construction â€“ Build an encoder-decoder style CNN model.


4. Model Training â€“ Train the model using noisy images as input and clean images as labels.


5. Results Visualization â€“ Compare noisy input images with denoised outputs.

How to Run

1. Open the CNN_DENOIS.ipynb notebook.


2. Run all the cells sequentially.


3. At the end, the notebook will display side-by-side comparisons of noisy and denoised images.
